            Hello, my name is Alexander and I am a Front-end developer. I live
            in Enschede and I enjoy learning new technologies in general. The skills
            that I have are HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue.js, Sass and Wordpress. I also 
            have some experience in UI/UX and I use Figma & sometimes Adobe Illustrator 
            for tooling. I also have knowlege in some back-end development since I worked 
            with C#, PHP and MySQL(For databases). I am always open for new challenges and 
            learning in general.

          <h5>HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL</h5>
          <p>
            In Recreate not only have I learned alot about front-end
            development, but also about working in Agile and Git. I have also
            learned how to plan my work effectively and to make the most out of
            my time there. My job was to make a Dashboard for customer of
            Recreate to show their progress in a project. I was in a team of
            three people, with me as the front-end and two people at back-end.
            My responsibility was to make the UI and overall design of the website 
            and I quite enjoyed my experience at Recreate in general. I have learned 
            a lot about the basics of CSS and JavaScript there and also how to work 
            in a team.

          <p>
            In this small startup company, I have created many things. From
            small features on a website to creating a complete Netflix-like
            website. The project I was working on is called VolKoren.tv and it
            was already an on going project for over a year. That was also my
            exam-assignment to graduate my MBO Level 4 program as an software
            engineer. Unlike Netflix with movies, the project was about making a
            website for customers to watch different kinds of choir
            performances. It could be from classic, romance or church choir to
            modern, pop and acapella groups from all over the Netherlands. The
            website is made with Wordpress, but the theme that is used there is
            created by me. Most of my work has been put into the theme
            development and my biggest challenge was to make it work for all
            devices.
